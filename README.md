# WattMeter-for-nvidia-GPU
A simple batch file that reads from nvidia-smi file (Located in C:\Program Files\NVIDIA Corporation\NVSMI) and returns the current power draw of the GPU in Watts.

Note: Be sure to place the file in the drive that has your drivers installed. In the case that it is not labeled as C you should edit the file and change @cd C:\Program Files\NVIDIA Corporation\NVSMI with your volume's label.

Always check the contents of a batch file after downloading!

In some cases windows may block the batch file so you should go in Properties and check Unblock.

I hope you like it!
